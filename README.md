# SimpleThrillerGame
This is not really a game project. It is more of a learning project. It was created based on a video by a youtuber and game developer named Ataberk Palacıoğlu (known as at0m). I just wanted to add some small touches to it and give it more suspense. You can think of this as a sample project and develop it and create nice thriller games.

## Gameplay Notes
Lantern is lighting with "F".\
Doors are opening with "E".\
**Little Note:** Don't forget to turn the volume down as you are on the way to the end of the corridor.
