# SimpleThrillerGame
This is not really a game project. It is more of a learning project. It was created based on a video by a youtuber named Ataberk Palacıoğlu (known as at0m). I just wanted to add some small touches to it and give it more suspense. You can think of this as a sample project and develop it and create nice suspense games.
